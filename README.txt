---SUMMARY---

Module aims to override the admin_toolbar module so that site administrators can provide
a custom menu admin toolbar on a per-role basis using menus other than the system admin
menu tree.

---INSTALLATION---

Install as usual at /admin/extend.

---USAGE---

1. Navigate to /admin/config/user-interface/custom-admin-toolbar to view the settings form.
(Make sure the "administer site configuration" is permission is granted to the user
accessing the module settings form.)

2. Select the specific roles that should view the overridden admin toolbar. To automatically
apply to all roles (except "super administrative" roles) do not select any roles (leave blank).

3. Choose the menu source to use as the overridden admin toolbar.

4. Hide extra miscellaneous menu tabs if desired.

5. Save the settings form, and clear the website cache.
